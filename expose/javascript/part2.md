### Expose Part 2

#Question 1:
Output:

3

Because the only output by line 12 is console.log(i), which the output will be var i. i represent the length of the list of price which is 3. Therefore, it output 3 by line 12.

#Question 2:
Output:

150

The program output 150 because at the end of the for loop, the var discounted price will be assigned with equation contains last element in prices list, which is prices[300] * (1-0.5). therefore, the discounted price is the last element's discounted price as that is the last assignment.

#Question 3:
Output:

150

The final price is a variable defined out of the box, but it will round the discounted price to 2 decimal to push out. The last reassign to the final price is when the last discountedPrice was processed at the last recurssion of for loop, wich the last element in the prices list, 300. And discounted price processed it to 150. So the final price is the round of the latest discounted price. Therefore, it is 150.

#Question 4:
Output:

(3) [50, 100, 150]

the function returned the new length of array as it add element to the finalPrice array. And the discounted pricese list because the function return the array. Therefore, the function return both the length of array and variables in the array.

#Question 5:
